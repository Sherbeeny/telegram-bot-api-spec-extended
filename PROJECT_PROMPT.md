# PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: AUTOMATE `extensions.json`

**Your primary goal is to build and maintain a script that automatically generates the `extensions.json` and `extensions.min.json` files on a weekly basis.**

This script must scrape all relevant official and community sources for non-spec information about the Telegram Bot API. The scraped data, including source URLs and highlighted text, should first be stored in a reference file named `extensions.ref.json`. This file will then be used to generate `extensions.json` and `extensions.min.json`.

Direct manual creation or updating of `extensions.json` is **not** the objective; the focus is on the automation script.

Additionally, we should investigate the feasibility of incorporating a lightweight AI component to enhance the script's ability to recognize relevant information and suggest optimal data structures, while staying within the constraints of the free GitHub Actions plan.

You are contributing to a public GitHub repository called telegram-bot-api-spec-extended:
https://github.com/Sherbeeny/telegram-bot-api-spec-extended

This repo automatically pulls the official Telegram Bot API spec JSON (api.json & api.min.json) from PaulSonOfLars/telegram-bot-api-spec every day.

I want you to now build and maintain a complementary JSON file, named extensions.json & extensions.min.json, which contain everything that the base spec files don‚Äôt include, but is essential for real-world mocking, testing, tooling, and understanding of Telegram Bot API behaviors.

the extensions files will later be merged the spec files to create spec-extended.json & spec-extended.min.json

‚úÖ You must format all extra data as valid OpenAPI extensions using the x- prefix (e.g., x-rate-limit, x-premium-access, etc.) to ensure that the final spec-extended.json will be a valid OpenAPI-compatible file.

‚úÖ You will write this extensions.json file as a clean object mirroring the Telegram API structure and methods, e.g.:

{
  "sendMessage": {
    "x-rate-limit": { "per_chat": 1, "per_second": 30 },
    "x-premium-restrictions": { "max_message_length": 4096 }
  },
  "forwardMessage": {
    "x-rate-limit": { "per_chat": 10, "global_per_minute": 300 }
  }
}

üß† You will need to create a script to be **weekly** run by a github action workflow to:
	‚Ä¢	Scrape data from https://core.telegram.org/bots/api, https://core.telegram.org/bots/faq, and https://core.telegram.org/bots/features
	‚Ä¢	Use known community knowledge, experiments, or test cases to deduce unofficial limits and behaviors
	‚Ä¢	Include documentation-specific fields like x-notes, x-simulated-behavior, x-likely-side-effects, etc.
    ‚Ä¢   Incorporate a lightweight AI component to enhance recognizing which info should be added to extensions.ref.json and the best structure/names to use for the keys/maps of that file as a supplement to api.json without repeating info because the two files will next be merged into spec-extended.json (considering that this script will run weekly on the free plan of GitHub)

üõë You should not copy data that is already present in api.json. Only augment or extend it with additional context, behaviors, and rules that Telegram does not officially define in their OpenAPI spec.

üìÅ The final output of the weekly script must:
	‚Ä¢   First create/update the file ‚Äúextensions.ref.json‚Äù which contains a reference url of the source of the info/behavior (anchor & text highlighted), name the key ‚Äúref‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	Then the script can generate ‚Äúextensions.json‚Äù & ‚Äúextensions.min.json‚Äù from the ‚Äúextensions.ref.json‚Äù.
	‚Ä¢	Be self-contained and structured for easy merging with api.json & api.min.json
	‚Ä¢	Avoid hard-coding unstable values (note any uncertainties via x-source or x-confidence)
	‚Ä¢	The merged versions: spec-extended.json and spec-extended.min.json


üß© Example categories to include per method or globally:
	‚Ä¢	x-rate-limit (global, per-method, per-chat, per-user)
	‚Ä¢	x-tier-access (premium vs non-premium, verified bots)
	‚Ä¢	x-webhook-behavior and x-long-polling-behavior
	‚Ä¢	x-restrictions (e.g., max number of buttons, max size of media, max length of messages)
	‚Ä¢	x-errors (typical errors this method may trigger and how to simulate them)
	‚Ä¢	x-expected-update-sequence (how Telegram behaves when responding to this method)

üéØ The goal is to build a foundation for realistic Telegram bot simulation that:
	‚Ä¢	Powers mocks and test engines (like telegram-mocker)
	‚Ä¢	Helps lint, simulate, and test edge cases in Telegram bots
	‚Ä¢	Works even when Telegram‚Äôs docs are incomplete or vague

Please start by generating a first draft of extensions.json with useful x- fields for at least 5 key methods: sendMessage, sendPhoto, editMessageText, answerCallbackQuery, and getUpdates.
